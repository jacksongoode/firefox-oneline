### A simple one-line theme (userChrome.css) for Firefox
This was inspired by [Cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade), another one-line theme for Firefox.

## Note:
This modification strips some of the custom styling and makes it such that the url bar is only available when a user is focused on it (Ctrl+L).
By hiding the url bar, you have full access to the tab bar. As an alternative to having the addons hidden with the url bar, I keep my addons on my bookmarks bar so will appear with the shortcut (Ctrl+B).
