# A minimal one-line theme for Firefox
Inspired by [Cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade), and other "one-liner" themes for Firefox. 

This modification strips some of the custom styling and makes it such that the url bar is only available when a user is focused on it (Ctrl+L).
By hiding the url bar, you have **full access** to the tab bar.

## Installing:
Checkout this [guide](https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html) and copy the `userChrome.css` into your `chrome` folder.

## Note:
As an alternative to having the addons hidden with the url bar, I keep my addons on my bookmarks bar so will appear with the shortcut (Ctrl+B).
